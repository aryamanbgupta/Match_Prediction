# Research Queue

Statuses: `PENDING` → `RUNNING <ts>` → `LANDED` / `TABLED` / `FAILED` / `CRASH`.
Rules: pull the highest-priority PENDING; append-only edits to history; new
ideas go at the bottom of their priority tier with a one-line rationale; max 2
new ideas appended per iteration; never delete an entry. TABLED ideas are raw
material for combination ideas (`C<n>`) once PENDING runs dry. Verdict logic
lives in `program.md` — both gate metrics up = LANDED, one = TABLED, none =
FAILED.

## A1 [P0] [RUNNING 2026-07-11T00:45Z] Fresh baseline + seed-variance floor
**Hypothesis:** the M7 headline (LL 0.6299 / ROI +21.90%) carries seed luck;
every later verdict needs an honest noise floor.
**Method:** retrain the M7 config (trainer defaults) 5× with different seeds
(add a `--seed` flag to `scripts/xgboost_match_v1.py` if not exposed — trainer
is editable, eval is not) → eval each via recipe A → record mean ± spread of
LL and ROI on ≥$50k. Append one `baseline` row to results.tsv with the mean,
and the spread in notes.
**Gate:** none — this is instrumentation; verdict is `LANDED` if 5 evals
complete. **Budget:** ~45 min.
**Result:** —

## A2 [P1] [PENDING] Seed bagging (5-seed probability ensemble)
**Hypothesis:** averaging predicted probabilities across the 5 seeds from A1
removes seed variance and improves both LL and ROI (variance reduction, no new
information — historically the safest kind of win).
**Method:** average `p_team1` across A1's five `test_predictions.json` files
into one prediction set → recipe A steps 2–3.
**Gate:** LL + ROI vs A1's fresh baseline mean. **Budget:** ~20 min (reuses A1
models; if A1 hasn't run, do its training step first).
**Result:** —

## A3 [P1] [PENDING] Direct + v7 sim blend, fine w-sweep
**Hypothesis:** a small sim weight (w ∈ 0.05–0.3) adds ball-level information
the direct model lacks, helping the close-match slice without hurting the
headline.
**Method:** `blend_eval_json.py` with `--w 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3` using the
existing envelope `eval_out_phase5_hier/hier_all_20260425_165622.json` +
production `test_predictions.json` → reslice each → compare ≥$50k and
close-match slice. Pick best w on ≥$50k only (avoid slice-shopping).
**Gate:** LL + ROI at the chosen w vs w=0. Pure eval composition — no
training. **Budget:** ~30 min.
**Result:** —

## A4 [P2] [PENDING] Alternative architecture: regularized logistic stack
**Hypothesis:** a heavily regularized logistic regression on the same 49
features is a different bias class; even if it loses standalone it may
ensemble well (if standalone fails but blend helps, TABLE with that note).
**Method:** train sklearn LogisticRegression (existing dep) on the same
parquet splits → recipe A. Optionally eval a 50/50 logit-average with M7.
**Gate:** LL + ROI vs fresh baseline. **Budget:** ~40 min.
**Result:** —

## A5 [P2] [PENDING] Feature interactions: ELO × venue, toss × venue
**Hypothesis:** matchup strength conditioned on venue character (chase bias,
scoring dist) carries signal the additive features miss.
**Method:** BEFORE training, run the correlation check (per repo discipline:
|r| > 0.5 vs an existing M1/M2 feature requires clearly higher target
correlation — see `feedback_correlation_check_before_features`). If it
passes: re-materialize to `data/auto/a5/`, train, recipe A.
**Gate:** LL + ROI vs fresh baseline. **Budget:** ~2 h (materialization).
**Result:** —

## A6 [P2] [PENDING] New data: historical weather (dew proxy)
**Hypothesis:** evening humidity/dew at the venue affects chase advantage
(wet ball), which the model can't currently see; strongest for night games.
**Method:** GET-only pull from the open-meteo historical archive for venue
lat/lon + match date (save raw under `data/external/weather/`); join
evening-hours humidity/temp as 2–3 match features; re-materialize to
`data/auto/a6/`; train; recipe A. Respect the correlation-check discipline.
**Gate:** LL + ROI vs fresh baseline. **Budget:** ~3 h — start only if >4 h
of night remain.
**Result:** —

## A7 [P2] [PENDING] Betting layer: slice-conditional edge threshold (M8 follow-up)
**Hypothesis:** requiring ~10% edge on mismatch fixtures (top6 ELO diff > 5)
while betting flat elsewhere improves ROI without touching predictions (M8
documented this but never forward-tested it as a rule).
**Method:** re-score production `test_predictions.json` bets under the
conditional threshold using the reslice outputs; compare ROI/CI.
**Gate:** betting-layer rule — ROI improves, predictions untouched → LANDED.
**Budget:** ~30 min.
**Result:** —

## A8 [P3] [PENDING] Sim: phase-conditional vector scaling (E5 follow-up)
**Hypothesis:** one global vector calibrator over/under-corrects by phase;
per-phase (PP/mid/death) scaling removes the residual bowler-wicket overshoot
without breaking what E5 fixed.
**Method:** fit 3 phase-bucket vector scalers on the same val ball data as
`vector_scaling_calibrator_v1.pkl`; add as `--ball-calibrator vector-phase`;
recipe B on n=261.
**Gate (sim pair):** wicket/PP overshoot vs single-vector run AND top_bowler
margin over fair baseline must not regress. **Budget:** ~2.5 h.
**Result:** —

## A9 [P3] [PENDING] E4 quantile pooling forward test
**Hypothesis:** pooling across the quantile ensemble (filed at E4 as a
forward-test hypothesis) improves tail calibration of match predictions.
**Method:** per the E4 report's stated recipe (`reports/` E-series); eval via
recipe A.
**Gate:** LL + ROI vs fresh baseline. **Budget:** ~1 h.
**Result:** —
